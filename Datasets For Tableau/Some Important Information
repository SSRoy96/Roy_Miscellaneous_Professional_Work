If some of the worksheets or perhaps an entire workbook isn't being displayed properly on Tableau then please load or import the datasets first before indulging in all the BI Reports or Dashboards.

--> The avocado.csv dataset is for the Ultimate Demo Retail Exercise File.
--> The online_retail_II.xlsb (Excel Binary File) dataset is for the Ultimate Comprehensive Tableau Exercise File.

In case the problem still persists, or for more information and assistance please mail at: sssovitech@gmail.com
